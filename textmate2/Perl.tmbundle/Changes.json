Here Documents\n\n# A line-oriented form of quoting is based on the Unix shell \"here-document\" syntax. Following a &lt;&lt;, you specify a string to terminate the quoted material, and all lines following the current line down to the terminating string are the value of the item. This is of particular importance if you're trying to print something like HTML that would be cleaner to print as a chunk instead of as individual lines. For example:\n\n#!/usr/local/bin/perl -w\n\nmy $Price = 'right';\n\nprint &lt;&lt;\"EOF\";\nThe price is $Price.\nEOF\n# The terminating string does not have to be quoted. For example, the previous example could have been written as:\n\n#!/usr/local/bin/perl -w\n\nmy $Price = 'right';\n\nprint &lt;&lt;EOF;\nThe price is $Price.\nEOF\n# You can assign here documents to a string:\n\nmy $assign_this_heredoc =&lt;&lt; \"EOS\";\nThis string is assigned to $whatever.\nEOS\n\n# You can use a here document to execute commands:\n\n#!/usr/local/bin/perl -w\n\nprint &lt;&lt;`CMD`; #dklksdjfsf sdf lkjsldf k\nls -l\nCMD\n\n# One caveat about here documents: you may have noticed in each of these examples that the quoted text is always left-justified. That's because any whitespace used for indentation will be included in the string. For example:\n\n#!/usr/local/bin/perl -w\n\nprint &lt;&lt;'    INDENTED';\n    Same old, same old.\n    INDENTED\n\n# Although you can use a trick of including whitespace in the terminating tag to keep it indented (as we did here), the string itself will have the whitespace embedded—in this case, it will be Same old, same old..\n\n\n# You can stack here documents:\n\n#!/usr/local/bin/perl -w\n\nprint &lt;&lt;\"joe\", &lt;&lt;\"momma\"; # You can stack them\nI said foo.\njoe\nI said bar.\nmomma\n\n# No string here!\n\n\n\n\ngit-svn-id: http://svn.textmate.org/trunk/Bundles/Perl.tmbundle@1085 dfb7d73b-c2ec-0310-8fea-fb051d288c6d","date":"2005-05-27T00:02:23+00:00","commit":"b230c5d6e6b4346588a4dc3cbcf45eb31ddff7cf"},{"author":"Chris Thomas","summary":"• Adjust keyword categories that the resultant syntax highlighting looks more like the Ruby and Python highlighting in any given theme • Prevent anonymous subs from being listed in the pop-up (they get listed as \"{\" otherwise, which is not helpful, in my opinion). • Strip pre-beta6 stuff","body":"git-svn-id: http://svn.textmate.org/trunk/Bundles/Perl.tmbundle@1032 dfb7d73b-c2ec-0310-8fea-fb051d288c6d","date":"2005-05-21T06:44:12+00:00","commit":"93a2e318f2a78f17a0696104b5b1d2045623e88d"},{"author":"Allan Odgaard","summary":"Changed all line comments to be named (if it made sense) like this:  comment.line.double-slash  comment.line.double-dash  comment.line.number-sign  comment.line.percentage","body":"git-svn-id: http://svn.textmate.org/trunk/Bundles/Perl.tmbundle@995 dfb7d73b-c2ec-0310-8fea-fb051d288c6d","date":"2005-05-20T19:06:12+00:00","commit":"1d80ac6f5c48f2d67622eaf85eb6e9f4c84cb503"},{"author":"Eric Hsu","summary":"- Tried to update language element names to the new hotness. - Sebastian Riedel pointed out that __FILE__ , __LINE__ , and __PACKAGE__ need special handling.
