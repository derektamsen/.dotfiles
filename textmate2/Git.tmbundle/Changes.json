This should be encapsulated into a SCM::Status class where instances are mostly created by name (and can then be queried about color, etc.)\n \n Selection: Most commands have logic to check if there is a selection (and then various variations of how to decode TM_SELECTED_FILES into an array), a project folder, a current directory, etc.\n \n Paths: Paths need to be pretty printed, that means, if we run on the project folder, they should be relative to this one, if we run on a selection, preferably they should be relative to the nearest common ancestor of the selection, finally they should fall back to being shown with the home folder abbreviated using a tilde — many commands presently have some custom logic that sort of does the above (but not quite, and each one re-invents the wheel).\n\nAnother issue is that of templates, I am thinking that templates for status, blame, and log can at least to some degree be re-used between SCM bundles.\n\nComments, ideas, etc. welcome.\n\n\ngit-svn-id: http://macromates.com/svn/Bundles/trunk/Work in Progress/Bundles/Git.tmbundle@7480 dfb7d73b-c2ec-0310-8fea-fb051d288c6d","summary":"My motivation for starting this bundle is that I want a nice SCM bundle that other SCM bundles can clone (and re-use the shared plumbing).","commit":"4c47a64b9527dbf229ec7e73d6d4f8bcab05f87b","date":"2007-06-10T15:41:03+00:00"}],"web":"https://github.com/textmate/git.tmbundle.git/commit/"}
